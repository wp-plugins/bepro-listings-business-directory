= How to Use =

Install BePro Listings then install this. Its that simple

This specific addon "Business Directory" will introduce several new listing templates that are popular for those trying to setup a directory website. First, you should add a few listings to the plugin, business, staff, or whatever you are listing. Then you can use any of the following shortcodes to reveal a particular layout:

	1. [display_listings type="bl1" order_by=1 limit=150]
	2. [display_listings type="blb" order_by=3 limit=150]
	3. [display_listings type="bl2" order_by=1 limit=150]
	4. [display_listings type="bl2b" order_by=3 limit=150]
	5. [display_listings type="bl3" order_by=1 limit=150]
	6. [display_listings type="bl4" order_by=1 limit=150]

You can use the following shortcode to setup an alaphabetic search option. So if you use a listing type that visibly shows alaphabetic listings, you should also use the following shortcode to help people navigate your records quickly.

[alpha_list]

Remember, you can also still use all of the other shortcodes included with BePro Listings. Ultimately, this plugin provides the layout you need and BePro Listings provides all of the other functionality.
