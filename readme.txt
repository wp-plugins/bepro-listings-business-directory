BePro Listings is a great foundation with features like, google maps, ajax search filter, Categories, front end uploads and so much more. Read more about whats possible on our wordpress.org page or via the documentations link bove.

= How to Use =

This specific addon "Business Directory" provides several listing templates that are popular for those trying to setup a directory website. First, you should install BePro Listings and add a few listings to it, business or staff, or whatever you are listing. Once BePro Listings is setup, you can use any of the following shortcodes to reveal a particular layout. LISTING SHORTCODE EXAMPLES

	1. [display_listings type="bl1" order_by=1 limit=150]
	2. [display_listings type="blb" order_by=3 limit=150]
	3. [display_listings type="bl2" order_by=1 limit=150]
	4. [display_listings type="bl2b" order_by=3 limit=150]
	5. [display_listings type="bl3" order_by=1 limit=150]
	6. [display_listings type="bl4" order_by=1 limit=150]

You can use the following shortcode to setup an alaphabetic search option. So if you use a listing type that visibly shows alaphabetic listings, you should also use this shortcode to help people navigate your records quickly.

[alpha_list]

Remember, you can also still use all of the other shortcodes included with BePro Listings. Ultimately, this plugin provides the layout you need and BePro Listings provides all of the other functionality.
